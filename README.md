# Virtual Astronomy Software Talks

## propose a talk

The Virtual Astronomy Software Talks is a monthly seminar on software
in astronomy, featuring 2 talks and an open discussion each seminar.
We wish for the organization of the seminar to be completely open, and
welcome community members to propose talks.

Have an idea for a VAST talk?  File an issue in this repo with your
ideas for the talk and the committee will consider.
